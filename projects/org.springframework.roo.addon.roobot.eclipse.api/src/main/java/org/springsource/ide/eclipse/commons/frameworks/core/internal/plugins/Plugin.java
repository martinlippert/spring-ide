/**
 * Represents a published plugin model, which among other things,
 * contains a list of published versions.
 * <p>
 * It specifies the latest version of the plugin as it would be installed IF the
 * plugin were installed without specifying a version number. NOTE that this is
 * NOT the same as being the most recent version of the plugin that is
 * available. There may be newer milestone versions available OR newer versions
 * that are only compatible with newer runtimes. Therefore this model provides two
 * API for retrieving new versions:
 * <li>
 * The latest version available for the given version of a runtime used by a
 * project. This is the version that is installed if a user installs the plugin
 * WITHOUT specifying a version number.</li>
 * <li>
 * The most recent version added, which may be a milestone or only available for
 * newer versions of a runtime, which a user must manually specify when installing
 * the plugin. As the list of versions are ORDERED, the most recent version
 * added version should be the last version that was added to the list.</li>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This model represents both a published plugin as well as an in-place plugin.
 * In-place plugins usually only have one child version (i.e the only version
 * that is available), and this version is considered the latest version.
